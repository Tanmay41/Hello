# Multi-Language Greeting Node App 🌍

Ever felt like the world's too big and you're just... lost in translation? Fear not! This whimsical Node.js app has got your back. It'll greet you in the language of your roots, all thanks to a sneaky peek at your location via the ipAPI.

**Fun Fact (or is it?):** 
I might be peeking at your IP, but don't worry! It's all in good fun. No dark web adventures here. Or... is there? 😉
